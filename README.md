## Introduction

This project performs a detailed analysis of an e-commerce dataset to understand customer behavior, product performance, and other key metrics. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `InvoiceNo`: Invoice number (6 digits). Starts with 'C' for cancellations.
- `StockCode`: Product code (5 digits).
- `Description`: Product name.
- `Quantity`: Number of units per transaction.
- `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of the transaction.
- `UnitPrice`: Price per unit of the product.
- `CustomerID`: Customer number (5 digits, unique).
- `Country`: Country where the customer resides.

### Key Observations

- There are outliers in `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.
- Negative values in `Quantity` and `UnitPrice` due to cancellations.
- Missing values in `CustomerID` and `Description`.
- Total price is calculated as `Quantity * UnitPrice`.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
├── data
│   ├── data.csv                # Raw dataset
├── CRM_Analytics.ipynb         # Jupyter notebook for analysis
├── README.md                   # Project README file
└── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
```

## Installation
